ðŸŽ¯ A/B Testing Projects

ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

This repository contains a collection of A/B Testing projects where I apply statistical analysis to evaluate experiment results and drive data-informed decisions. Using Python, SQL, and data visualization, I analyze user behavior, measure key performance indicators, and optimize business outcomes.

ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Experimental Design â€“ Setting up A/B tests with control and variant groups.
Hypothesis Testing â€“ Using t-tests, chi-square tests, and Bayesian methods.
Statistical Analysis â€“ Measuring statistical significance and confidence intervals.
Data Processing & Cleaning â€“ Preparing datasets for accurate analysis.
Business Insights â€“ Making data-driven recommendations based on test results.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels)
SQL (Data extraction & manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
A/B Testing Frameworks (t-test, chi-square, z-test, bootstrapping)

ðŸ“‚ How to Use

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ab-testing-projects.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the notebooks or scripts to analyze test results.

ðŸ“¢ Feedback & Contributions
Iâ€™m always open to feedback and discussions on A/B testing methodologies. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute!
