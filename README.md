# A-B-Testing-Projects
This repository contains my A/B Testing projects, where I apply statistical methods to evaluate experiment results and optimize decision-making. Using Python, SQL, and data visualization tools, I analyze user behavior, measure key performance indicators, and draw data-driven conclusions to improve business outcomes.
